# Noise.jl

*Ambient Noise Cross-Correlation in Julia.*

Noise.jl provides routines for quickly and efficiently implementing [seismic interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_interferometry).

!!! note

    Much of the I/O and preprocessing in Noise.jl uses the [SeisIO.jl](https://github.com/jpjones76/SeisIO.jl) package. Please read through the [SeisIO Documentation](https://seisio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get familiar with seismic data processing in Julia.

## Package Features
  - Built upon [SeisIO](https://seisio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for easy and fast I/O.
  - Custom types for saving Fourier Transforms of data and cross-correlations
  - Array-based processing of raw data and cross-correlation.
  - Coming soon: methods for $dv/v$ and dispersion measurements.
  - Coming soon: GPU support.
